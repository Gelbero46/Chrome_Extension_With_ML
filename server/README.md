Chrome extention using ML on server side

# for the ML server side
run "python ML_Chrome.py" in the current directory using the command line/terminal
to start the server. you don't need your IDE if python.exe is set as an environment 
variable. If not use your IDE.


# for the extension: 
- Extract to a folder
- launch Chrome browser and type "chrome://extensions/"
- Click "load unpacked" and select the extension folder.
Let me know if you encounter any problem.
Thanks.
